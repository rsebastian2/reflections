1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git init initializes the metadata directory .git but does perform any adds
or commits.  The user may add and commit the files as they wish with appropriate
comments which git could not supply.  

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a list of files ready for commit.  The working directory 
actually contains the files.  The repository contains the metadata to track
and recover commited versions of the files.  "Staging area" provides a 
better conceptual mapping to usage than the generic term list.
